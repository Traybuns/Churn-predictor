Empowering Data-Driven Decisions with Kubernetes and AWS EKS! 🌟

I’m thrilled to share my latest project: Customer Churn Prediction using Kubernetes. In today’s data-driven world, predicting customer churn is vital for businesses to improve retention strategies. To achieve this, I deployed a scalable and resilient churn prediction application in a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

🔑 Highlights of the Project:
✅ Cluster Setup:

    Created and managed an EKS cluster (churn-cluster-v2) with eksctl.
    Configured auto-scaling node groups for cost-efficiency and performance optimization.

✅ Application Deployment:

    Built and containerized the churn prediction model using Docker.
    Deployed the application via Kubernetes, leveraging its robust scaling and fault-tolerance capabilities.

✅ Integration & Configuration:

    Exposed the application through Kubernetes Service, ensuring seamless external access.
    Managed dynamic configurations with Kubernetes ConfigMap.

✅ Automation & Monitoring:

    Used Kubernetes addons like coredns, metrics-server, and vpc-cni for streamlined operations.

💡 This project demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with cloud-native technologies to deliver scalable and efficient solutions. It’s a testament to the potential of leveraging Kubernetes for real-world applications, ensuring high availability and robust performance.
